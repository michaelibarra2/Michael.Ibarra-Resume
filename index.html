        <p class="lead mb-4">I was raised by two Mexican parents, one of which was educated and graduated from a 4-year university and the other who only made it to middle school. Being a son of four, I was taught that education was the most important thing in the world. My parents knew the struggle of living in the United States without having any sort of diploma. They expected us to get good grades and perform to the best of our abilities and there was no other choice. Well, I grew up loving school and worked hard to attend my choice of university- University of California, Riverside. I strive to be successful one day with my self-motivation and personal drive. Education is the backbone of a country. It is an integral tool that aids the development of human civilization. Education equips the nation with the workforce, uplifts awareness among the general public, and promotes national unity. A life without education is valueless. Education makes oneself-sufficient, knowledgeable, intelligent, independent and boosts self-confidence. It enhances our thought process and enables us to do things creatively and correctly.
Education promotes national unity through the contributions of the diverse workforce such as Lawyers, Doctors, Engineers, Judges, Administrative officials, Teachers, Economists, and other technical hands. John Amos Comenius is crowned as the ‚ÄòFather of Modern Education‚Äô, who put forth various kinds and forms of education. According to John Amos, education is not confined within the classrooms. He has written various education theories, methods, and systems which states that illusions as students cannot be learned only by reading.

        However, Success is much more than riches, power or fame. Success is simply the feeling of satisfaction and happiness one gets from leading a particular way of life or carrying out a particular activity. Success in any field or aspect of life can only be achieved through serious hard work and a little bit of opportunity. One of the most important recipes of success is determination and it might as well be the most important secret of success. To become successful, it is necessary to never give up until the aim of happiness and satisfaction in life is fully met. The happiness and satisfaction can be found in very different things in different people.

        As we grow up, the cost of our happiness increases. We may route our happiness through earning an education, having a family, developing social relationships, or even by keeping busy doing various activities. Happiness may become dependent on someone else, or by doing or obtaining something. But when you embody happiness, you make better decisions, and your life becomes enriched and effortless. ‚ÄúWhen do you really feel well in your life? When you‚Äôre really happy, you‚Äôre well. Even if you‚Äôre physically ill you‚Äôre still well. Isn‚Äôt it? Fundamentally, well-being means a certain level of joyfulness, a certain exuberance of life. What is happiness? We can say happiness is this or that, but in terms of life, your life energies are happening in a more exuberant way than it normally happens. Depression means your life energies have become in a very low state. Happiness means your life energies are exuberant. ‚ÄúEverybody has been happy, but the problem is they‚Äôre not able to maintain it. All this effort of life, everything that you did‚Äîeducation, career, business, family, whatever you did‚Äîwas in pursuit of happiness. Everything that humanity has done on this planet is in pursuit of happiness.‚ÄùSadhguru is a realized yogi, mystic, and visionary who has dedicated himself to the elevation of the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of all people. He is an author and opinion maker who is regularly invited to speak at leading prestigious international forums and conferences such as World Peace Summit at the United Nations and the World Economic Forum.
